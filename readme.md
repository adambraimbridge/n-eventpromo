# n-eventpromo

Eventpromo is used to promote content from [live.ft.com](http://live.ft.com).

## Installation

This module is compatible with Node 12+ and is distributed on npm.

```bash
npm install --save @financial-times/n-eventpromo @financial-times/x-engine
```

This module also requires [`x-engine`][engine] as a peer dependency. The Engine module is used to inject your chosen runtime into the component. Please read the `x-engine` documentation first if you are consuming `x-` components for the first time in your application.

## Usage

This module is used by [n-magnet](https://github.com/Financial-Times/n-magnet).

With react
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Eventpromo } from '@financial-times/x-eventpromo';

// A == B == C
const a = Eventpromo(props);
const b = <Eventpromo {...props} />;
const c = React.createElement(Eventpromo, props);
```
All `x-` components are designed to be compatible with a variety of runtimes, not just React. 
Check out the [`x-engine`][engine] documentation for a list of recommended libraries and frameworks.

### Linking to an application

This package does not have a demonstration application, so to test we can link to [`n-magnet` repostiory](https://github.com/Financial-Times/n-magnet) which consumes this.

Complete the installation for `n-magnet` locally then link `n-eventpromo` by running:

```sh
cd ../n-magnet
npm link ../n-eventpromo
make build && make demo
```

When making changes after first linking `n-eventpromo` run:

```sh
# in ./n-eventpromo
make build
# in ./n-magnet
make build && make demo
```
